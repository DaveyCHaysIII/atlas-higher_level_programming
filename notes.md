importing

from FILE import THING - file being a file in PATH without extention, THING being a variable, function, w/e from that file

if __name__ == "__main__": -makes it not run interactively?

print("{}".format(a)) - sticks the var a in place of the brackets, like printf in c
len() - length of something
dir() - contents of someting in alpha order


lists are very similar to arrays but are growable and can contain w/e different data sets you want

list = [1, 2, "string", 1.234]
